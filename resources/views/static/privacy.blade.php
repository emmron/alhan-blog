        <p>It's very simple: this website uses <a href="http://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>, which uses cookies to track <strong>anonymous</strong> user activity, such as page visits and clicks. This information is securely transmitted to Google Analytics and is primarily used to boost the website owner's ego whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Unless you choose to fill out a web form on the website with your personal information, <strong>this website tracks no personally identifiable information</strong>.</p>
        <p>Also:
            <ul>
                <li>Your anonymous Google Analytics data is not shared with any 3rd parties.</li>
                <li>Your IP is not stored.</li>
                <li>The 'user Id' feature is not used in Google Analytics.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are pieces of data stored in your browser and help tools like Google Analytics recognize you as the same visitor when you come back to a website or when you navigate between pages using the same browser.</p>
